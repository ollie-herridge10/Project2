# Ping Pong Game

This is Ping Pong game made out of mainly JavaScript with elements of HTML and CSS. The aim of the game is to bounce the ball off of the left paddle which the user controls and try to get the ball past the right paddle which the computer controls. 


# Site Goals

The aim is to use the left ping pong paddle to score a higher points than the computer operated paddle on the right hand side. 

The ball will be served to the computer first everytime, the computer paddle will react to hit the ball in the direction of the players paddle where the player will use their mouse to control the paddle. Everytime the ball hots the paddle, the ball speed will increase making it harder and harder to judge where the ball might go. 

If either player misses the ball, the opposing player will gain a point. The player with the most points after you stop playing, is the winner.
